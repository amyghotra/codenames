## Running Codenames Locally
### Frontend
- Navigate into the codenames folder in your directory
- Run `npm install` to run the necessary packages
- Run `npm run` once the package installation is complete
### Backend
- Make sure that you have MySQL locally installed
- Run your local MySQL with the command `mysql.server start`
- Navigate to codename_database/codenamesdatabase/settings.py and modify the Database section by using your personal/local database credentials
- Comment out `local_settings.py` if necessary
- Navigate to codename_database/codenames/serializers.py and modify the path in the `getGameWords()` function. Right-click the odename_database/codenames/words.csv file, obtain the path, and substitute the original path with your new one
- Start Redis by running `redis-server --port 5379` in your local terminal
